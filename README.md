# Open on GitHub (VS Code Extension)

## What it does

- Adds a command, context menus, and an editor title button to open the current file on GitHub for the active branch.
- Supports both HTTPS and SSH remotes (including GitHub Enterprise hosts).
- Preserves the current text selection by appending GitHub line anchors (e.g., #L10-L20).

## Usage

- Editor: Click the GitHub button in the editor title bar, right-click in the editor and choose "Open on GitHub", or press Cmd+Alt+G (macOS) / Ctrl+Alt+G (Windows/Linux).
- Explorer: Right-click a file and choose "Open on GitHub".

## Notes

- Prefers the `origin` remote; falls back to the first remote if `origin` is missing.
- If the branch name is unavailable (detached HEAD), it uses the current commit SHA.
- Works with GitHub Enterprise by using the remote host detected from your repo URL.

## Install (local)

1. Open this folder in VS Code.
2. Press F5 to launch an Extension Development Host and try the command/menus.

## Install (VSIX)

- Build locally: `cd open-on-github && npx @vscode/vsce package` (outputs a `.vsix`).
- Install: `code --install-extension open-on-github-*.vsix` or via Extensions view → … → Install from VSIX.

## GitHub Release (CI)

- Push a tag like `v0.1.0` to the repo. GitHub Actions will build `open-on-github.vsix` and attach it to the release.
- Team can download the VSIX from the release and install it.

## Marketplace (optional)

- Create a VS Code publisher, set `publisher` in `package.json`, then run `npx vsce publish` (requires a Marketplace PAT). See https://code.visualstudio.com/api/working-with-extensions/publishing-extension.
